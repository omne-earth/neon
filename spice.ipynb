    "We use *SPICE* (**An Observation Geometry System\n",
    "for Space Science Missions**) to create SPICE files from the results of our simulation. SPICE allows representation of space geometry and events in 3D. A brief introduction from JPL provides a concise overview of the SPICE toolkit from JPL.\n",

    "The SPICE toolkit can be used to load *SPK* files as upstream source which contains data in the binary format. The same toolkit can be used to package raw data into *SPK* files for downstream consumption. *NEON* predominantly to use the toolkit for creating the *SPK* files\n",

    "*NEON* will:\n",
    "1. Collect raw data from JPL *Horizons* system\n",
    "2. Include **ALL** NEO objects currently known and available\n",
    "3. Train an N-body extrapolation model from retrospective data using iterative simulations\n",
    "4. Augment prospective data using the generated model\n",
    "5. Package the data into *SPK* payloads using the NAIF *SPICE* toolkit\n",
    "6. Allow a consistent API for downstream consumption\n",
